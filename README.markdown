# Overview
BAT is a highly-adaptable, native Scala library for analyzing Java bytecode. It implements the complete 
infrastructure necessary for reading Java 7 class files. Additionally, BAT offers a default
representation of Java bytecode that facilitates writing analyses.

BAT in particular provides support for the analysis of static source code dependencies. Furthermore, it 
provides extensive support for pattern-matching on Java Bytecode to facilitate the development of custom analyses.
