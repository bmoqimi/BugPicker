		<ul>
			<li>Clicking on a class's name (found in the first column) will show that class's bytecode in the bytecode tab.
			If you specified a source directory <em>and</em> the source for this class could be found, it will be loaded in the source tab.</li>
			<li>Clicking on a method's name (found in the second column) will first load bytecode (and, if available) source code of the class surrounding that method as above.
			Then, it will scroll both tabs to the method in question.</li>
			<li>Clicking on a <code title="program counter">PC</code> will load the bytecode of the respective class in the bytecode tab and then scroll the view to this <code>PC</code>.</li>
			<li>Clicking on a line number will load the source code (if available) of the respective class in the source tab and then scroll the view to that line.
			If no source could be found, it will instead load the bytecode and scroll to the <code>PC</code> that most closely corresponds to the line number.</li>
