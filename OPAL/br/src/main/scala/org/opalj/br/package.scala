     * An upper type bound represents the available type information about a
     * reference value. It is always "just" an upper bound for a concrete type;
     * i.e., we know that the runtime type has to be a subtype (reflexive) of the
     * type identified by the upper bound.
     * Furthermore, an upper bound can identify multiple '''independent''' types. E.g.,
     * a type bound for array objects could be: `java.io.Serializable` and
     * `java.lang.Cloneable`. Here, independent means that no two types of the bound
     * are in a subtype relationship. Hence, an upper bound is always a special set where
     * the values are not equal and are not in an inheritance relation. However,
     * identifying independent types is a class hierarchy's responsibility.
     *
     * In general, an upper bound identifies a single class type and a set of independent
     * interface types that are known to be implemented by the current object. '''Even if
     * the type contains a class type''' it may just be a super class of the concrete type
     * and, hence, just represent an abstraction.
