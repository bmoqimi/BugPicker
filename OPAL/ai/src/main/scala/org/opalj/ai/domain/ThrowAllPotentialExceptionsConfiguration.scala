/**
 * Centralizes all configuration options related to how a domain should handle
 * situations in which the information about a value is not completely available and
 * which could lead to some kind of exception.
 *
 * Basically all domains that perform some kind of abstraction should mix in this trait
 * and query the respective method to decide if a respective exception should be thrown
 * if it is possible that an exception may be thrown.
 *
 * ==Usage==
 * If you need to adapt a setting just override the respective method in your domain.
