/**
 * Makes the instance of the abstract interpreter that performs the
 * abstract interpretation available.
 *
 * ==Usage==
 * It is sufficient to mixin this trait in a [[Domain]] that needs to access the abstract
 * interpreter. The abstract interpreter will then perform the initialization.
 *
 * The concrete instance of [[AI]] that performs the abstract interpretation is set
 * immediately before the abstract interpretation is started/continued.
