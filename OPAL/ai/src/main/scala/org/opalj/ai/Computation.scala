/**
 * Encapsulates the result of a computation in a domain. In general, the
 * result is either some value `V` or some exception(s) `E`. In some cases, however,
 * when the domain cannot ''precisely'' determine the result, it may be both: some
 * exceptional value(s) and a value.
 *
 * In the latter case the abstract interpreter will generally follow all
 * possible paths. Please note, that a computation that declares to return a result
 * (i.e., `V` is not `Nothing`) must either return a result and/or throw an exception, but
 * is not allowed to return no result and no exceptions!
 *
 * @tparam V The result of the computation. Typically a `DomainValue`;
 *      if the computation is executed for its side
 *      effect (e.g., as in case of a `monitorenter` or `monitorexit` instruction)
 *      the type of `V` maybe `Nothing`.
 * @tparam E The exception(s) that maybe thrown by the computation. Typically,
 *      a `DomainValue` which represents a reference value with type
 *      `java.lang.Throwable` or a subtype thereof. If multiple exceptions may be
 *      thrown it may also be a set of `DomainValue`s.
 *
 * @note The precise requirements on the result of a computation are determined
 *      by the [[Domain]] object's methods that perform computations.
