/**
 * OPAL is a Scala-based framework for the static analysis of Java bytecode
 * that is designed with performance, scalability and adaptability in mind.
 *
 * Its main components are:
 *  - a library for reading in Java bytecode and creating arbitrary representations
 *  - an easily customizable framework for the abstract interpretation of Java bytecode.
 *  - a library to extract dependencies between code elements. 
 *
 * ==General Design Decisions==
 *
 * ===Thread Safety===
 * Unless explicitly noted, '''OPAL is thread safe'''. I.e., it is possible to read
 * and process class files concurrently without explicit synchronization on the
 * client side.
 *
 * ===No `null` Values===
 * OPAL generally does not make use of `null` values in its public interface. I.e.,
 * fields that are accessible  will never contain `null` values and methods will never
 * return `null`. **If a method accepts `null` as a value for a parameter or returns
 * a `null` value it is always explicitly documented.**
 * In general, the behavior of methods that are passed `null` values is undefined.
 *
 * ===No Typecasts for Collections===
 * For efficiency reasons OPAL sometimes uses mutable data-structures during construction
 * time. After construction time, these data-structures are generally represented using
 * their generic type interfaces (`scala.collection.{Set,Map}`). However, a downcast
 * (e.g., to add elements) is always forbidden as it would effectively prevent the
 * thread-safety properties. Furthermore, the concrete data-structure is always
 * considered an implementation detail and may always change.
