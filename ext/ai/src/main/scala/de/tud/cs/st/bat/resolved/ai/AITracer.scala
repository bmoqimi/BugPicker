/**

 * tracing the interpreter's behavior. In general, a tracer is first registered with an
 * abstract interpreter. After that, when a method is analyzed, BATAI calls the
 * tracer's methods at the respective points in time.
 *
 * A tracer is registered with an abstract interpreter by creating a new subclass of
 * `AI` and overriding the method `tracer`.
 *
 * @note In general, all mutable data structures (e.g. the current locals) passed
 *      to the tracer must not be mutated by it.
