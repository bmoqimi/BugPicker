Things that need to be done:

* We need some support for Invokedynamic.

* Do we want to support JSR/RET or do we want to explicitly drop support for it?

* Improve the possibility for tracing/controlling the progress of the AI.

* Implement a framework to analyze projects. Here, we should support something like a on-demand loading of class files to limit the amount of memory that is required.

* We need MORE tests.

* We need more (precise) domains. (We also need a vision how to support dynamic domain-upcasting.)

* Develop a concept to derive and store the intermediate results of abstract interpretations.
